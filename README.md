# rshell_challenge

This is a practice python script for ways to break out of a restricted shell. 

## Usage
```
python rshell.py <difficulty>
```
Difficulty may not necessarily be how difficult it is to escape but rather how creative or how much nuance is required.


## Story
There is a story connected to this rshell. A story about a lonely security engineer who is trying to make a secure version of rbash.

1. His first attempt was very sloppy work. He banned the basic redirections and looked up `rbash shell escape methods`. He then wrote down all the commands he saw that a user could use to escape. Lets hope his next iteration is better!

2. Our security engineer is getting better, quickly realizing that there is a long list of commands and text editors that should probably be disabled. `sh is a shell too ya know!`

3. His third attempt is one of frustration. Who would have thought his own `enviornment` would be his undoing! He restricted even more symbols to the point where its questionable to even call this a shell.

4. Unfortunately it seems each attempt is riddled with flaws. Poor security engineer cant seem to outsmart the hackers. After pooring through logs he discovered what caused the previous breach. He decided he has had enough with that `language` all together.

5. So much obscurity in the linux kernel. `Scripting` can be so dangerous sometimes. However, our engineer is now confident that there is no way to pull off the previous exploit.

6. After many tears and popped shells, our security engineer is on his last leg. "`Bash` is gone" he said. No more scripting. No more languages. No more `variables`. It has to be secure now.

7. Oh man! That last exploit is as old as bash! Infact, some may even call it a `feature` of the program before its improved brother can to light. After a quick blacklist, we are back in business. Our engineer feels hopeful that with enough trial and error he can do this.

8. Our engineer stares at his computer screen. "I am going to restrict everything. Can't escape what doesnt work right?"
